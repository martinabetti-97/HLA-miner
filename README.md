## Flowchart 
- Dashed boxes stand for processes that are not included in the main analysis. However the scripts for such analysis are available in the repository.
- Red boxes represent the external softwares used for the analysis. 
- Yellow boxes represent the main processes of the analysis.
- Blue boxes represent databases that have been used to enrich the analysis.
- Orange boxes are the files produced by external data processing.
- Grey boxes represent the output of the analysis.

## Usage
All the scripts must be launched from the HLA-typing directory. 

### Primary analysis 

The primary analysis consists of the HLA-typing by Optitype from paired fastq samples. The the results are resumed in a single file (*hla.tsv*), which is later used for post processing.
Optitype is lounched virtually through docker, make sure it is globally available (documentation https://github.com/FRED-2/OptiType).

The absolute path of the files to be analyzed must be specified, the results are written in a subdirectory of that indicated for the input which name must be specified.
To run the analysis:
```bash
bash primary_analysis.sh -i /path/to/input/files -o output/
```
#### Prefiltering step

Due to memory issues, optitype may require a prefiltering step to be able to operate the alignment. The documentation about this process is available at the optitype repository.

In this repository a script is provided to operate this step throught BWA. The reference sequence to be used for this step is available at the optitype repository and must be indexed with BWA, which path (-a) must be specified when launching the script together with the output (-o) and the input (-i) directory, as it follows:
```bash
bash optitype_prefiltering.sh -a /path/to/bwa/indexed/reference/genome  -i /path/to/input/fastq/files -o /path/to/output/filtered_samples/
```
------------------------------------
### Secondary analysis

The secondary analysis consists of a post processing of the files produced with the primary analysis.
To run the analysis one must indicate the input info file (-i) and the input haplotype table file (-f) that must be in the same format as *test/hla.tsv*. The output will be generated by default in the /output directory of the repository, but a different one can be specified (the new directory will be created if it does not exist). An optional -e argument can be specified to run an additional ethnicity analysis while -h will print usage.
```bash
bash secondary_analysis.sh -i /abs/path/to/info_file -f /abs/path/hla_haplotype -o /abs/path/to/output [-e] [-h]
```
This analysis relies on an additional file which must be maually filled in by the user. The structure is given: 

| sample  |group   |  ethnicity |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Sample_1  | NR/R/NA | arab/asian/austronasian/black/caucasian/global  |

> Group: NR (non responder), R (responder), NA (unknown). If NA is used that sample is not included in the analysis.

> Ethnicity: asian, austronasian, arab, black, caucasian or global (global is to be used if ethnicity is not known or if it is different from the ones listed before). 

> Sample ID: can have any format but it will be substituted to produce better visualizations (substitution info table will be produced as output).

Other external files used by the pipeline:

- **distance.tsv**
Grantham distance matrix is provided to calculate the distance between the two aminoacids (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4843792/).

- **sequence.fa**
Aminoacid sequences for all annotated alleles of genes A, B and C of the HLA locus (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ipd/imgt/hla/alignments/). This sequences will be used together with Grantham's distance matrix for the calulation of the distance between the two alleles co-occuring in an individual.

- **supertypes.xls**
This tsv file is used to convert HLA alleles into more general supertypes according to their antigen binding ability. This classification is used to simplify the dimentionality of the analysis. The original file can be found at the following link: https://bmcimmunol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2172-9-1 .

#### Results
The produced results are listed below:
1. Division of the samples analyzed into subgroups based on response and ethnicity; association of single alleles to correspondent supertypes.
	- **hlaST.tsv** - present the same structure and content of the file "hla.tsv" but reports supertype associated to alleles. Unknown supertypes are omitted.
	- **ids.tsv** - info file on sample ids substitution.
	
2. Calculation of allele frequencies in a group specific way. Produced files:
	- **ethnicity_freq.tsv** - The relative frequency of occurence of any allele predicted from the primary analysis is calculated and added to the table accordingly with the ethnicity that the individual is labeled with. If it is not known the "global" must be assigned.
	- **resp_a_freq.tsv** - The relative frequency of occurence of any allele predicted from the primary analysis is calculated and added to the table accordingly to the response group that the individual is labeled with.
	- **resp_st_freq.tsv** - Same information given by resp_a_freq.tsv but based on supertypes rather than single alleles. Gene C is not included in this classification.
	- **diff_a_boxplot.png** - Boxplot of allele frequency distance distribution.
	- **diff_st_boxplot.png** -  Boxplot of supertype frequency distance distribution.
	
3. Homozygosity frequencies and alleles of interest.
	- **homo_freq.tsv** - The frequency of homozygosity for each gene (A, B and C) is calculated globally and for the two response groups.
	- **homo_info.txt** - Individuals affected by homozgosity are listed and the allele they are homozygous for is specified.
	- **A/B/C_homoCounts.tsv** - Counts of homozigous vs. heterozigous patients for genes A, B and C. 
	- **homo_fisher.txt** - Checking categorical indipendence between homozygosity and response to treatments. Results are reported for single genes.
	- **homoGene_barplot.png** - Comparison between homozygosity frequency in R vs. NR for genes A, B and C.
	- **homoAllele_barplot.png** - Comparison between normalized counts of homozygosity for specific alleles.
	
4. Calculation of Grantham distance for alleles co-occuring in an individual.
	- **HED.tsv** - Each individual is assigned with the distance between his couple of alleles for gene A, B and C separately and with a mean distance value between these three.
	- **HED_wilcox.txt** - Wilcox test resuts on genes A, B and C.
	
5. MCA analysis on HED categories and relative plots.
	- **groups.png** - individuals are grouped based on the response group they are labeled with.
	- **biplot.png** - individuals are clustered depending on their response group and related variables are shown.
	- **contibution.png** . percentage of variance explained.
	- **variables.png** - categorical variables are plotted accordingly to their similarity and are filtered and coloured according to their cos2.
	- **MCA.txt** - in this file all the quantitative data reguarding the MCA anlysis are reported.
	
6. Production of heatmaps and circular graphs.
	- **HED_heatmap.png** - A heatmap which represents the distance between alleles in all patients. An additional annotation boxplot informs on the variability of distances for the three genes while another specify to which group the patient belongs. Patient clustering is provided.
	- **ethn_freq_heatmap.png** - A heatmap that highlights defferences in the allele frequency among different ethnic groups. 
	- **response_freq_heatmap.png** - graphic representation of allele frequency for the two response groups with an annotation of distance in allele frequency between the two groups.
	- **responseST_freq_heatmap.png** - graphic representation of allele frequency for the two response groups based on supertypes rather than single alleles.
	- **A/B/C_circleplot.png**, **A/B/C_ST_circleplot.png** - graphic representation of alleles co-occurence in responders vs. non-responders for the three genes.
